All the HTML, CSS and Javascript files of the website being built.

Innitial mockups can be found here: https://moqups.com/Fl4m3Ph03n1x/D0wFddho

WIP:
 - Right now I am just trying to make my index page as loyal to the mockup as 
possible. Once I completely finish this page, I will move on to the others, but 
the index HTML is the main priority so far. 
 - I appreciate any support and feedbak and help that you people may be able to
provide.

TODO: 
 - Change color when I hoover over buttons.
 - Highlight button of currently selected page. This means that I have to pick a
darker color for the other button menus, or not use gray as a background color 
for them. 
 - Have no idea how to fit biogaphy and news into nice boxes like I have on the 
mockup. 
 - No idea how to fit image as well.
